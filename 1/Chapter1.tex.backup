\section{\uppercase{Format of the thesis}}
A few guidelines for writing the thesis are given below. These are taken from Ph.d regulations of Anna University \cite{regulations}. 
\subsection{Table of Contents}
The Table of contents should list all captions following it as well as any caption which precedes it. The title page, Certificate and Acknowledgment will not find a place among the items listed in the Table of Contents but the page numbers of which are in lower case Roman letters. One and a half line spacing should be adopted. 
\subsection{List of Tables and Figures}
The list should use exactly the same captions as they appear above the Tables and Figures in the text. One and a half line spacing should be adopted.
\subsection{List of Symbols and Abbreviations}
One and a half line spacing should be adopted for typing the matter under this head. Standard symbols, abbreviations, etc.
should be used.
\subsection{Chapters}
The chapters may be broadly divided into 3 parts (i) Introductory chapter, (ii) Chapters developing the main theme of the Thesis and (iii) Results, Discussion and Conclusion. The main text shall be divided into several chapters and each chapter may be further divided into several divisions and sub-divisions. 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Each chapter should be given an appropriate title.
 \item Tables and Figures in a chapter should be placed in the immediate vicinity of the reference where they are cited.
 \item Footnotes should be used sparingly. They should be typed single space and
placed directly underneath in the very same page which refers to the material
they annotate.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Appendices}
Appendices are provided to give supplementary information, which if included in the main text may serve as a distraction and cloud the central theme under discussion.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Appendices should be numbered using Arabic numerals, e.g. Appendix 1, Appendix 2, etc.
\item  Appendices, Tables and references appearing in appendices should be numbered and referred to at appropriate places just as in the case of chapters.
\item Appendices shall carry the title of the work reported and the same title shall be included in the Table of Contents page.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{References}
Any works of other researchers, if used either directly or indirectly, the origin of the material thus referred to at appropriate places in the thesis should be indicated. 
\subsection{Citation}
A few examples for citing articles, books and website are given in Chapter \ref{ch:survey}. 
\subsection{Tables and Figures}
A Table or Figure including caption should be accommodated within the prescribed margin limits and appear on the page following the page where their first reference is made.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Tables and Figures on half page or less in length may appear on the same page along with the text. However, they should be separated from the text both above and below by triple spacing.
\item Tables and Figures on half page or less in length may appear on the same page along with the text. However, they should be separated from the text both above and below by triple spacing.
\item All Tables and Figures should be prepared on the same paper or material used for the preparation of the rest of the Thesis.
\item Two or more small Tables or Figures may be grouped if necessary in a single page.
\end{itemize}
